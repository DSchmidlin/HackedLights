HackedLights
============

A project allowing an Android client to control a Sylvania Mosiac Light strand.

The Android client communicates to an Arduino over Wifi which in turn sends out the appropriate IR codes to the Sylvania Mosiac light strand.

This project has a dependcy on the Arduino IR library found here: https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote and the Arduino CC3000 wifi library found here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CC3000_Library

A pre-built version of the Android Client can be installed using the provided APK file, which was built using the debug keystore.
